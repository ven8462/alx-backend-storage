# 0x01-NoSQL

## NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL" and refers to a type of database management system that is different from traditional relational databases. 
## Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema and are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. 
## They provide flexible data models and horizontal scalability, making them suitable for handling big data and real-time applications. 
## NoSQL databases are commonly used in modern web applications, where the data requirements may change frequently and need to be scaled horizontally.
